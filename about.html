          <p>With 20+ years in furniture and interior execution, Ranjeet has worked across apartments, villas, offices, cafes and bars throughout India.</p>

          <p>RS coordinates carpenters, POP teams, electricians, polish teams and other contractors so you work with a single point of responsibility.</p>
